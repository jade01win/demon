# demon
fuck these demons, I am so triggered.

Encrypts every file in your Home.

***

Works on both Windows and Linux.

Run server > run demon.py

Compile demon.py to EXE, make it a nice image or some shit and brick your Windows.

Anti-virusses don't give a damn.


Maybe Ill add a decrypter someday also.
